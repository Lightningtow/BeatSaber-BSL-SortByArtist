# BeatSaber-BSL-SortByArtist
Adds a "song artist" sort for BetterSongList

A huge thank you to SteffanDonal, author of [BeatSaber-BetterSongList-PlayCount](https://github.com/SteffanDonal/BeatSaber-BetterSongList-PlayCount), which I used as the basis for this mod.

Confirmed to work on Beat Saber 1.40.8, likely to continue working on future versions as long as BetterSongList doesn't get changed too much
